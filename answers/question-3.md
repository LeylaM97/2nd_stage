## Question 3
### Student description
Every time she come into office - it will be yelling, screaming bad words and no any, even tiny, explanation of what happened. Its clear that she screams because of her code, which is not working at all. You tryed to ask what is the reason and she answered using offensive comments like - "Who the hell are you? You don't even have 10 years of programming experience, how did you even get into this job?.

### Surround factors
You are online mentor in the group of this student. Lets name her - Lisa. 

So your previous homework code review was taken very harshly by Lisa, and there is no any edits in her repository since that day.

You asked Lisa, where is her next homework and why did she ignored the required edits to previous one. And you finally got an answer.

### Question itself
I will not listen to any amators. They promised real specialists with strong background, but I found an unskilled child instead of a mastodons.

I don't believe in your qualification. Who I need to text to ask them fire you?

### Answer
I will thank the student for feedback and send the requested information.
