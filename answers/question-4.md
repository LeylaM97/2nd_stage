## Question 4
### Student description
Have a good grades for all the homeworks. nice code style and do all the edits. Teacher says that he is silent and always codding something on the lessons. Probably it means a good understanding of all the basics.

### Surround factors
"You are offline mentor. Student name is Paul. Comunication between you and Paul is not often, but always about details of specific implementation, like what approach is better or what tool should he pick to write a code.

Pauls group is in the process of learning of prototypes.

Right now you have 2 students working around you on js-tabs hamework and there are 2 more after the Paul in the queue.
After 1 hour your working day will ends."

### Question itself
Hi.

I'm working on the optional homework with Tanks game.
I realized that I want to implement some kind of AI that will complete the game automatically with max level of success.

I implemented Deixtra algorythm to find closest enemy, but its not perfect....there is A* algorythm that I would loike to implement, but didn't get how its possible. Could you please help me.

### Answer
I will ask the student to wait a bit (since he is already working with an additional task). Then I will ask students in the queue about their questions. First, I will answer questions on the topic, and then questions related to the additional task.
