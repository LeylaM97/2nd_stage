## Question 2
### Student description
From the day when the course was started, this student didn't text you not even once. He didn't complete any homework, but teacher says that he is one of the best students in the group, always follow all instructions and even asked for a homework review a couple of times.

### Surround factors
You are an offline mentor. The question is related to the topic that is not covered by the course and you don't know how to complete it. 
All the meeting with 80% of students for today completed or held back for tomorrow.
There is another teacher from another course, who probably could help and he is at office right now. Bu the way your strongly interested to figure out and have any experience in that topic.

### Question itself
Hi. 
I created some 3-languages and 4-pages site for my friend and don't know how to place it on the wordpress. Deadline is tomorrow evening, could you please help me to do that?

### Answer
Since there is free time and opportunity, I will ask another teacher for help with a student's question. 
I will also ask about the reason why the student did not complete any homework.
